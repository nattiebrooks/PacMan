# Pac-Man Notes for Modifications


## Features to Add
- make ghosts follow pac man    v.3 release
- enable stop/restart buttons   v.2 release
- update colors/graphics        v.1.5
- ~~created versions~~       

## New Fetures Notes
- v2 I want the ghosts to move towards pacman. I will have to refactor moveGhosts()
    I see a direction variable that is a random number, I think I could try to
    modify that and let it be a check for pacman's position. I will have to 
    constantly adjust this varaible everytime that pacman moves.
